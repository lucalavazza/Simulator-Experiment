# Simulator-Based Experiment

This is the Python implementation of the Simulator-Based experiment for the work "Dynamic Causal Bayesian Optimisation with Prior Knowledge", produced by Luca Lavazza for the research of the same name written by Luca Lavazza and Federico Cerutti.

Based on the work [Dynamic Causal Bayesian Optimization](https://github.com/neildhir/DCBO), [Yawning Titan](https://github.com/dstl/YAWNING-TITAN) and [Developing Optimal Causal Cyber-Defence Agents via Cyber Security Simulation](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/causal-cyber-defence), its main feature is the [notebook](https://github.com/lucalavazza/Simulator-Experiment/blob/main/SIMULATOR_EXPERIMENT/simulator_YT/PISCHAT.ipynb)  built to execute the experiment.
